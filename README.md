### Abstract

Minesweeper is a puzzle game that was bundled with early versions of windows intended to
teach the users about how to interact with the interface. It has received a significant attention
from the mathematicians and computer scientists, who developed a myriad of methods in an
attempt to solve or approach the game. In this paper, we explored ways of utilizing different
evolutionary algorithms, mainly genetic algorithm and genetic programming, to create a solver
for the minesweeper game or problem related to it.
